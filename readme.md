# My Odin Library

## Background
---
This project is an assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library) to develop a small library application. Its purpose is purely educational.

## Objectives
---
* all books are stored in an array
* display all books of the array in a UI
* add button that brings up a form where user can input **title**, **author**, **page number** and a **read status**
* add button to each book entry to remove the book from the library 
* add button to each book entry to change its read status

## Approach
---
First I have designed a mockup in Figma.
![Mockup of "My Library" app dashboard](<readme-content/Screenshot from 2024-08-24 10-31-20.png>)
![Mockup of "Add new Book" buttons modal](<readme-content/Screenshot from 2024-08-24 10-31-40.png>)

Then I took over the design into code using HTML and CSS. 

## Lessons learned
---
* text alignment issue on chrome browser when using specific fonts e.g. "Nimbus Sans"
